WIP/Goals:
[ ] Example files for all components to demonstrate basic workflows
	[ ] Layout from Bounding Box (multipart template printing?)
	[ ] Activate View (Bake geometry to different layouts, like a BOM)		
[ ] Check that DisplayMode inputs work in other languages
[ ] Bake to Layouts (to allow programmatic baking of geometry to paperspace with a layout as additional object attribute)
[ ] Switch view input for details from view attributes (target, displayMode, projection) to CurveComponents.Make2DViewParam
[ ] Create custom gh params for referencing DetailViewObject and PageView
[ ] Change object references to DetailView and Layout/PageView params in RH8
[ ] Add PaperName & Orientation as inputs to New Layout Component
[ ] Add Plane or View input for Layout from Bounding Box to allow non-XY views
[ ] Add component to label details (name, auto-number, scale)
